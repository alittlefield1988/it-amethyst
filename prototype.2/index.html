      <h2>Kinder Introduction</h2>
       <p>As the only true dual purpose goat bred to excel in both milk and meat production, the Kinder goat is ideal for the hobbiest, homesteader 
       and goat enthusiast. The Kinder’s mid size makes them easy to handle, and a safe choice for families and lone handlers, and their friendly 
       personalities make them a joy to be around.</p>
       
       <p>Kinders make a large amount of milk for their size, and their milk tends to be sweeter and higher in butter fat than most other breeds. 
       This makes it ideal for cheese-making and soaping as well as drinking. Reaching 70% of their full weight before they reach a year, with a 
       dress out percentage of around 60%, they are also a wonderful option for those interested in raising goats for meat. They are very efficient 
       in their feed conversion rate, and their milk and meat have both been rated as best tasting in competitions. Hardy and thrifty, these goats 
       truly are the perfect breed!</p>
      
      
      <h3>Breed History</h3>      
       <p>The first three Kinder® does were born in Snohomish, Washington in 1986. After the death of their Nubian buck, Zederkamm Farm bred two 
       Nubian does to the Pygmy buck they had on hand simply to get them back in milk. They were pleasantly surprised by the growth rate, great 
       temperament, and darling appearance of the resulting kids – Briar Rose, Liberty, and Tia. As they matured, the new does continued to impress, 
       boasting high quality milk, ease of kidding, and multiple kids in each freshening.</p>
       
       <p>Liberty was the first Kinder doe entered into official milk test (DHIA). She earned her star by fulfilling the same requirements as those
       set by ADGA for standard dairy goats. Other local goat enthusiasts soon became involved in the Kinder goat project. In 1988, Teresa Hill, 
       Daralyn Hollenbeck and Kathy Gilmore came together to form the <em>Kinder Goat Breeders Association</em> for the advancement of the breed. 
       The first Kinders were registered in <strong>1989</strong> and a new breed was born!</p> 
       
       <p>Kinders were introduced nationally through a front page article in United Caprine News, January 1989. This small nucleus Kinder goats 
       and a handful of breeders in the Snohomish, Washington area was soon followed by the entrance of Bramble Patch Kinders in Miami, Missouri. 
       Sue Huston of Bramble Patch Kinders was inspired by the UCN article to start building their own herd of fine Kinders and in turn encouraged 
       others in Missouri to join in.</p> 
       
       <p>The association, run by volunteers, established the standards to which breeders today should strive towards and continues to advance the 
       breed. This could not have been done without the help and encouragement of many individuals, including other goat breeders and judges. Special 
       note should be given to the Considines of Herd Evaluation Service (HES- Portage, WI). The KGBA refined the Kinder Goat Breed Standard with the 
       expert help of Harvey Considine. In addition, HES designed a scorecard specifically for the dual purpose (milk and meat) Kinder. The Association 
       later registered a trademark for the Kinder® name to protect the breed standard, ensure a single breed registry, and pursue the continuous 
       improvement of the Kinder goat.</p>

       <p>Kinders are now distributed throughout the United States, with herds spread from one coast to the other. They can even be found in Alaska and 
       Canada! There are now well over 3000 Kinders in the herd book. Not only has the breed become very popular among homesteaders and family farms 
       but these little goats have gone on to become star milkers, grand champions at breed shows and in both meat and milk classes at local shows. 
       Kinders are a unique, versatile breed that has won the hearts of many goat enthusiasts. <q>What amazing little goats they are!</q> claim people
       that have been around them.</p>
         
         
      <blockquote>"I chose Kinder Goats because they really are the best of both worlds. They are big enough to have a great meat yield, at the same time
      they are very capable of producing plenty of milk for your family!"
      <cite>Anya Littlefield, Kinder Goat Owner</cite>

      <h3>Breed Standard</h3>
       <p>The Kinder® is a midsize goat that is well proportioned in body length and legs. Its compact physique conforms to dairy characteristics despite 
       its somewhat heavy bone and lean, yet well muscled structure. The Kinder goat is a prolific, productive, alert, animated, good-natured and gregarious 
       breed.</p>

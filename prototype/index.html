      <h2>Old Reliable</h2>      
       <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. 
      Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of <em>Albert</em>.
      Gordo's historic flight took place on <strong>December 13, 1958</strong> when he took off from Cape Canaveral 
      for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board 
      instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight 
      were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space 
      was a modest slowing of his pulse. <q>Gordo was one heck of a monkey!</q> claimed scientists.</p>
      <h3>The Mission</h3>
       <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape
      Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and 
      reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 
      1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

      <blockquote>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to 
      think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us 
      is send a man up to do a monkey's work."
      <cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>
       <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army 
      as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed 
      by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic 
      ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

        <li>Launch Time: 03.53 EST</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Journey</h3>
       <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The 
      space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded 
      his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.</p>
